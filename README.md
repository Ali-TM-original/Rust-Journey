##  This repo marks my journey to learning Rust

  

<h1>The main entry point is in ./src/main.rs</h1>
All the practice code is imported to main.rs file and then tested out one by one

```rust
// Just like this
mod package_name;

fn main(){
	// Have a look in the package file to see what the
	// Public function is called
	package_name::public_function();
}

```
